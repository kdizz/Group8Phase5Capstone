## Navigating the Repository

There are a total of 6 branches (main, saron, bruce, audrey, patience, Khadija). The entire and final complete project is in the main branch. The other branches were created for task allocation for the group members; however due to constraints, we abandoned the branches and worked together fully on the main branch. 

The models are connencted to the notebook containing EDA; i.e. any notebook that is titled 'Main project plus...' will include similar work on the inital pages, however the models shall be towards the bottom, this was done due to compatibility issues brought about by tensorflow and other package incompatibilities, thus we couldn't run the notebooks when merged into a single notebook. ARIMA is the only model that was hosted separately.
